This specification is in 2240/a1 on our git server (theoretically). 

Part 2 and Part 1 are separate programs. 
You must have a makefile to create both of them. 
The executables will be named A1Part1 and A1Part2.
When A1Part2 is executed input will be 3 letter codes
 using read() from standard input. 
The program will finish when '0''0''0' is provided from user. When the program executes the output should be at least 'civil'. For example, inform the user of the above protocol. 
If the country code does not exist inform the user and prompt "May I have another, sir ?"
