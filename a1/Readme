There are two parts to this assignment:

part 1 reads in the data file, 
creates a sorted array of structs and a matching index array, using country code as a key. then both arrays are written to two binary files
the struct contains a character code, name, population and life expectancy

part 2 reads in the index array form the binary file and allows the user to search for a record by country,
 if the record is found the records.bin file is opened and prints the wanted recrod directly
 
To compile both part1 and part2 you can just run $make

to compile part1: $make A1part1

to create part2: $make part2

to remove parts one and two: $make clean


000 will exit the program
